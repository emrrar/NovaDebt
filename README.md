# NovaDebt - A desktop application that manages debtors and creditors for the user.

# Project Description
**NovaDebt** is user-friendly, easy to use and interactive desktop app that takes care of the debtors and creditors
of the user. The user is no logner obliged to remeber everyone from whom he/she has borrowed money
and to whom he/she has lent.

# Diving deeper
Technically the data is stored on the device itself (locally). Rest assured. The data isn't sent anywhere over the internet.
Only you know it.

# Idea features
**Enhanced Security** - Currently the application doesn't have any kind of authentication or cryptography used it in.
One of the future plans is to include a registration and an every time log in which will be used to decrypt the data (which the app uses) upon log in and encrypt it back upon application exit.

**Cross-Platform** - Right now the application is running only on Windows. In the future it can be developed as a mobile app and be able to run both on Android and iOS.
